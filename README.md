# Bus as a Service -BaaS-
BaaS is a system that allows organizations and businesses to manage their trips, save their employeesâ€™ time, effort and make their own profit.
## Project Objective:
To provide organizations with the ability to provide periodic trips for their employees or frequent attenders.
This would be a convenient solution for both organizations and their employees. Organizations would benefit by having their employees attend at the best possible time as they create and manage their own routes. The employees would have a convenient and reliable method of reaching their businesses.
The main application would allow organizations to register and create routes, they would then specify the stops for these routes. Organizations should also create accounts for their employees who would want to join these routes. Employees who would be bus passengers in this scenario would then use the application to book particular routes.
The application also gives a lower priority to normal users who would want to book certain routes or trips but who are not members of these organizations. Organizations control whether they want outsiders to book their routes or not.
